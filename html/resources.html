            <h5 class="card-subtitle">Rating: 5 out of 5</h5>
            <p>An overview of twelve sensors generally found in all smartphones. Sensors consist of mainly three types— 1) Motion Sensors: detects acceleration or rotation, 2) Environment Sensors: detects air pressure, temperature, light, and humidity, 3) Position Sensors: detects the physical position of the device, whether in landscape or portrait mode. </p>
            <p>Introduction on sensors are broken into manageable units. Not only does it illustrate real-world examples of how smartphones use the sensors for which functionality, it also points out which sensors are not widely used or are exclusively found on which phones.</p>

            <p>Documentation on framework that can access motion or environment data generated by sensors from the hardware of iOS devices. Gathered sensor data includes raw values and processed values, which are biased or inaccurate data caused by user interaction, such as acceleration caused by the user not by gravity.</p>
            <p>Not all types of sensors have good documentation and some types are missing documentation. Provided code examples are also inconsistent in programming languages where some are written in Object-C or Swift, and do not provide examples in both languages.</p>

            <p>The guide provides an overview of types of sensors, their definition and functionality, and usage. In addition, it provides documentation on how to access raw sensor data on devices through the Sensor Framework in the <span>android.harware</span> package.
            </p>
            <p>The built-in classes and interfaces within the framework are as follows—</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>SensorManager:</strong> Acts as a main controller. A created instance can control various events, such as accessing and identifying sensors on the device, toggling registration and unregistration of sensor event listeners, and modifying the rate for acquiring data.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Sensor:</strong>Acts as the sensor object. A created instance for the target sensor.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>SensorEvent:</strong>Keeps track of sensor events. A created instance can access information about a sensor’s event by acquiring raw sensor data, knowing the type of sensor that caused the event and the timestamp of the event’s occurrence.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>SensorEventListener:</strong> Keeps track of changes in sensor values and changes in accuracy of the sensor data.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The documentation provides detailed descriptions for each major sensor event and unit of measurement and provides code examples on how the implement the framework in Kotlin and Java.</p>

            <p>Roadmap is a projection of what W3C plans to implement in the future. The guide gives an overview of how they are implementing sensor and geolocation APIs for the web with information on the current browser compatibility, the responsible working group, and API maturity.</p>
            <p>Regarding APIs concerning sensors, Generic Sensor API and Motion Sensor Explainer are further documents to be consulted. Generic Sensor API is a framework with the purpose of standardizing the use of sensor data in a Web platform and includes a brief infographic on sensor life cycle. Motion Sensors Explainer is an introduction to low-level motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) and high-level motion sensors (fusion sensors that use more than one type of low-level motion sensors), and provides common usages or examples in the real world.</p>
